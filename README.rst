A Django app for interacting with the Agile Ticketing API

**Warning:** This app should be considered alpha. It is currently 
being used and is stable in a production environment. However, 
its only been tested against our current Agile configuration- 
more general tests are incomplete. Additionally, if you're reading this you are 
likely familiar with the quirks of working with the Agile API, so its 
possible there could be issues with other Agile setups.
